                <p>I started color grading film back in 1995 after graduating with my B.S. in Telecommunications and Video Production. I worked with 3 other seasoned colorists and soon formed my style of color.</p>
            <p>Since then I have been mastering my skill and technique on broadcast TV commercials, music videos, independent films and documentaries. Working with cinematographers, directors and creatives, I have helped to transform their raw footage into amazing images that help tell their story or sell their clientâ€™s product.</p> 
            <p>I experienced the transition from film to digital and learned the subtle and sometimes drastic differences in all these new forms of motion picture.</p>
            <p>I started out at Broadcast Video in Coconut Grove and in 2000 joined Cineworks Digital Studios in Miami. I spent 13 years at Cineworks as a senior colorist while continuing to learn the nuances of the art of color grading.</p>
            <p>In 2013 I decided to part ways with Cineworks and start my own company where I could have the freedom to work with whoever I wanted and not be confined to a set number of clients. It has also allowed me to have a more personal, one on one relationship with my clients and be able to find creative ways of making their projects shine.</p>
            <p>I provide final color grading of finished projects as well as offering on set and on location color grading and DIT services. I also am able to provide out of town clients with the opportunity to supervise color correction remotely.</p>
            <p>Recently I have even begun doing color grading workshops at the film schools at FSU, Fullsail and UM. Teaching and grading thesis films helps keep me in touch with this young, new generation of filmmakers and also allows me to guide them in the art of color grading.</p>
             
            <p>I would love to talk to you about how I can help you create an amazing look on your next project!</p> 

            <p>Thank You,</p>
            <p>Matt Perrin</p>
